## Coursework 1 - 8-Queens
The first coursework was to develop and implement a Python solution for the [8-queens problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eight_queens_puzzle).

We were provided with a fixed position for one queen on a chessboard and had to compute placements for seven other queens, such that no queen could take another in a single move. 
The program was then required to output one, or all, valid solutions to a text file. 

## Coursework 2 - Basic Language Processing
The second coursework was to develop a Prolog program to parse and evaluate the validity of sentences against a specified grammar and dictionary. 

This solution involves defining a categorised lexicon that can be queried for valid words, and a series of sentence and clause queries that can be combined to generate any permitted sentence. 
The program can be provided with a sentence, and will return a boolean of whether it is valid under the ruleset, or be provided with a number of wildcard variables and will return all valid sentences matching the permitted structures and the corresponding values of those variables for each sentence. 

This coursework was evaluated against a number of known test sentences (included at the end of main.pl) and by running it against a number of unknown sentences to test edge-cases and ensure correct specification implementation.
